<h2>A brief history of computers (Reference: Computer Organization and Architecture by Willian Stallings)</h2>
<p>In 1946, von Neumann and his colleagues began the design of a new stored-program computer, referred to as the IAS computer, at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies. The IAS computer, although not completed until 1952, is the prototype of all subsequent general-purpose computers</p>

<h2>About this assignment (course: Computer Architecture)</h2>
<p>The main goal of this project was to develop a simulator of the IAS processor as described in Stallings’ book. Below is the structure of this computer:</p>
